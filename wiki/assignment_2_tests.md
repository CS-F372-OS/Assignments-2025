# Pintos Threading Tests

## Test Descriptions

0.  **alarm-priority**: Combines the alarm clock with priorities. It checks if sleeping threads wake up in priority order, not just timer order.

1.  **priority-preempt**: Tests the core of preemption. When a new thread with higher priority becomes ready, it should immediately preempt the currently running lower-priority thread.

2.  **priority-change**: Tests whether a thread's priority can be lowered with `thread_set_priority()` and that this change correctly causes the thread to yield to a higher-priority one.

3.  **priority-fifo**: Checks that when multiple threads have the same priority, they are scheduled in a "first-in, first-out" (FIFO) order.

### Priority Donation with Locks

4.  **priority-donate-one**: The simplest donation case. A medium-priority thread holds a lock that a high-priority thread needs. The medium thread's priority should be donated to match the high-priority one.

5.  **priority-donate-multiple**: A thread holding a lock is waited on by multiple other threads. Its priority should be elevated to match the highest priority among all waiting threads.

6.  **priority-donate-multiple2**: Similar to the above, but with a more complex interaction of three threads and two locks.

7.  **priority-donate-lower**: Tests that a thread's priority correctly reverts to its previous value after it releases a lock that had caused a donation.

8.  **priority-donate-nest**: This testcase demonstrates nested priority donation: a low-priority thread holding lock A receives a priority boost from a high-priority thread waiting for lock B, via a medium-priority thread blocked on both locks, ensuring the highest-priority thread's progress despite lock dependencies.

9.  **priority-donate-chain**: This testcase demonstrates chained priority donation, where increasing thread priorities are passed along a sequence of lock holders all the way up to a low-priority main thread, ensuring higher-priority threads are not starved by nested lock dependencies, with interloper threads confirming correct scheduling order.
