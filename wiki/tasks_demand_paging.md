# Demand Paging Assignment - Tasks

## 1. Setup and Branching

Your repository has two remotes:

* `public` → The public repository containing the assignment.
* `origin` → Your personal fork.

### Steps:

1. **Fetch the public branch:**

```bash
git fetch public demand-paging-assignment
```

2. **Create and switch to a local branch:**

```bash
git checkout -b demand-paging public/demand-paging-assignment
```

3. All work for this assignment should be done on the `demand-paging` branch.

## 2. Files Overview

This assignment involves three main files:

### `frame.c`

Handles **physical frame allocation and eviction**.

* Frames represent physical pages in memory.
* Key functions and TODOs:

  * `frame_init()` → Initialize all frames at startup.
  * `frame_alloc_and_lock(struct page *p)` → Allocate a frame for a page; evict a frame if memory is full.
  * `frame_free(struct frame *f)` → **TODO:** Mark a frame as free so it can be reused. Do not remove existing lock handling.
  * `frame_lock(struct page *p)` → Lock a page’s frame in memory.
  * `frame_unlock(struct frame *f)` → Unlock a frame, allowing it to be evicted.

---

### `page.c`

Handles **virtual page metadata** and page table management.

* Pages are backed by:

  * **Files** (executables, memory-mapped files)
  * **Swap**
  * **Anonymous memory** (stack, heap)

* Key functions and TODOs:

  * `page_for_addr(const void *addr)` → **TODO:** Round address down, create a temporary page, look up in hash table, return the page if found.
  * `page_in(void *fault_addr)` → Bring the page into memory on a page fault.
  * `page_out(struct page *p)` → Evict the page from memory. Write to swap or file if necessary.
  * `page_allocate(void *vaddr, bool read_only)` → Allocate a new page structure and insert into hash table.
  * `page_deallocate(void *vaddr)` → **TODO:** Remove page from hash table and free memory.
  * `destroy_page()` → Used as a callback for hash table destruction at process exit.

---

### `swap.c`

Handles **swap space management**.

* Key functions:

  * `swap_init()` → Initialize the swap device and bitmap.
  * `swap_in(struct page *p)` → Load a page from swap into memory.
  * `swap_out(struct page *p)` → Write a page from memory into swap.

* Make sure `swap_in` and `swap_out` properly update page metadata.

---

## 3. Assignment Tasks

### 3.1 Frame Management (`frame.c`)

* Implement `frame_free()` to mark frames as free.
* Understand how eviction works when all frames are in use.
* Ensure proper locking to avoid race conditions.

---

### 3.2 Page Management (`page.c`)

* Implement `page_for_addr()` to look up pages in the hash table.
* Implement `page_deallocate()` to remove pages safely.
* Implement **demand paging during page faults**:

  1. Modify `page_fault()` in `userprog/exception.c` to call `page_in()` only for **not-present pages**.
  2. Ensure that page faults for **read-only violations** or **kernel accesses** are handled by `kill()` (do not demand page them).

---

## 4. Testing

To verify your implementation:

1. **Build the VM tools**:

```bash
cd pintos/src/vm
make
```

2. **Run the test suite**:

```bash
cd build
make check
```

3. Review the output of `tests/` to ensure that **demand paging** and **page fault handling** pass all relevant tests.

## Known Issues and Fixes
## Critical Bug #1: Uninitialized Sector Field
**Location:** `page_allocate()` in `vm/page.c` and `load_segment()` in `userprog/process.c`

**The Problem:**
- The `p->sector` field in page structures was never initialized
- Defaulted to `0` instead of the expected `(block_sector_t)-1` (indicating "not in swap")
- This caused `do_page_in()` to incorrectly route ALL file-backed pages to swap loading instead of file loading

**The Effect:**
- Executable pages tried to load from swap sector 0 (garbage data)
- All instruction pages came up as all zeros (`00 00 00 00`)
- Programs would page fault immediately after code page loading

**The Fix:**
```c
// In page_allocate():
p->sector = (block_sector_t)-1; // Explicitly mark as "not in swap"
```

## Critical Bug #2: Corrupted File Metadata
**Location:** File offset and byte count fields in page structures

**The Problem:**
- File offsets showed values like `17592186044416` (should be small file offsets)
- Byte counts showed values like `47244640255` (should be ≤ 4096)
- `file_read_at()` returned negative byte counts (`-4294963200`)

**The Evidence:**
From debug output:
```
load_segment: file_offset=17592186044416, file_bytes=3222307852
do_page_in: offset=17592186044416, bytes=47244640255
Actually read -4294963200 bytes
```

**The Workaround:**
Implemented forced full-page reading when metadata appears corrupted:
```c
size_t bytes_to_read = PGSIZE; // Just read a full page
if (p->file_bytes > 0 && p->file_bytes <= PGSIZE) {
bytes_to_read = p->file_bytes; // Use original if it looks sane
}
```

These bugs completely mask whether demand paging is working correctly. Students can implement perfect page fault handling, frame allocation, and TLB management, but the system will still fail due to these underlying issues.
