# Introduction to Shell Programming

## What is a Shell?

A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system by typing commands. It acts as a bridge between the user and the operating system kernel, interpreting commands and executing them.

### Key Concepts

**Command Line Interface (CLI)**: A text-based interface where users type commands instead of using a graphical interface.

**Command**: A text instruction that tells the shell what to do (e.g., `ls`, `cd`, `echo`).

**Arguments**: Additional information passed to commands (e.g., `echo hello` where `hello` is the argument).

**Output Redirection**: The ability to send command output to files instead of the screen using operators like `>`.

## Shell in Operating Systems

### Role of the Shell

1. **Command Interpretation**: Parses user input and determines what action to take
2. **Process Management**: Creates and manages running programs
3. **File Operations**: Provides commands for file and directory manipulation
4. **Environment Management**: Handles variables and system settings

### Common Shell Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `ls` | List files and directories | `ls -la` |
| `cd` | Change directory | `cd /home/user` |
| `echo` | Print text to screen | `echo "Hello World"` |
| `touch` | Create empty file or update timestamp | `touch filename.txt` |
| `cat` | Display file contents | `cat file.txt` |
| `mkdir` | Create directory | `mkdir newdir` |
| `rm` | Remove files | `rm file.txt` |

## Shell Programming Concepts

### Command Structure

A typical shell command has this structure:
```
command [options] [arguments]
```

- **Command**: The program to execute
- **Options**: Modify command behavior (usually start with `-` or `--`)
- **Arguments**: Data the command operates on

### Output Redirection

One of the most powerful features of shells is the ability to redirect output:

```bash
# Send output to a file (overwrites existing file)
echo "Hello" > output.txt

# Append output to a file
echo "World" >> output.txt

# Send error output to a file
command 2> error.log
```

### Pipes

Pipes allow you to connect commands together:

```bash
# Send output of one command as input to another
ls -la | grep "\.txt"
```

## Pintos Shell

The Pintos operating system includes a basic shell implementation that you'll be enhancing in this assignment. The Pintos shell provides:

- Basic command execution
- File system operations
- Process management
- A foundation for more advanced features

### What You'll Learn

Through this assignment, you'll gain experience with:

1. **Command Implementation**: How to create and implement shell commands
2. **File System Operations**: Working with files and directories
3. **Output Redirection**: Implementing the `>` operator
4. **Error Handling**: Managing command failures and edge cases
5. **System Programming**: Understanding how shells interact with the OS

### Assignment Context

In this assignment, you'll be working with the Pintos shell to:

- Fix existing command behavior
- Implement new commands
- Add advanced features like output redirection

This hands-on experience will help you understand:
- How operating systems handle user input
- The relationship between user programs and the kernel
- File system operations and process management
- Real-world shell programming concepts

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

- Understand how shell commands are implemented
- Modify existing command behavior
- Create new shell commands from scratch
- Implement output redirection functionality
- Debug and test shell commands effectively
- Understand the relationship between user programs and the operating system
