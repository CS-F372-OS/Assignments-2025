# Submitting the Assignment

## Important Notes
- **Work only on the "shell" branch** - Do not merge to main as this might create merge conflicts for future assignments
- **Ensure your commit is made before the deadline**
- The hasher script is located in the project folder of the assignments-2025 repo

## Step-by-Step Submission Process

### 1. Commit Your Changes
- Make sure all your changes are committed to the assignment branch (`shell`)
- Verify you're on the correct branch before committing
- Run `git status` and make sure there are **no staged changes or untracked files**

### 2. Generate the Hash
Run the hasher command from the project folder:
- **For Windows/Linux/Intel Mac**: `./hasher_x86_stripped`
- **For Mac - M series**: `./hasher_arm_stripped` 
- To get the file, go to the main branch in the Assignments-2025 repo, and download the file, or merge the latest public/main branch into your shell branch.

### 3. Get Your Commit Hash
- Run `git log` to view the commit history
- Copy the latest commit hash from the output:

```
commit b86c56541501b46fc023e11ce4bd262d927adf2e (HEAD -> docs, origin/docs)
Author: Druva <ddruva445@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Aug 20 15:42:55 2025 +0530
    fix formatting
```

- Copy the full commit hash: `b86c56541501b46fc023e11ce4bd262d927adf2e`
- Press `q` to exit the `git log` command

### 4. Submit the Form
Submit the [Google form](https://forms.gle/8cARsUdZrr1geiYn9) with the following information:
- **Commit Hash**: The hash you copied from `git log`
- **Hasher Hash**: The hash generated by the hasher script
- **Branch Name**: `shell`
- **Group ID**: Your assigned group identifier


## Troubleshooting
- If you don't see the hasher script, make sure you're in the correct project folder of the Assignments-2025 repo
- If the hasher script doesn't execute, check file permissions: `chmod +x hasher_x86_stripped`

**Remember**: All work must be done on the `shell` branch and committed before the deadline!
